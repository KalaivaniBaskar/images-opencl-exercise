 The matrix representation of a grayscale image and a colored (RGB) image differs in terms of the number of channels used to represent each pixel.

Grayscale Image:

In a grayscale image, each pixel is represented by a single intensity value, usually ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
The matrix representation is a 2D array where each element corresponds to the intensity value of a pixel.
Example:

Grayscale Image:
[[ 0, 128, 255],
 [64, 192, 128],
 [32,  16,  64]]

 
Colored (RGB) Image:

In a colored image, each pixel is represented by three values: Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B). These values typically range from 0 to 255 for each channel.
The matrix representation is a 3D array where each element is a vector representing the RGB values of a pixel.
Example:

Colored (RGB) Image:
[[[255,   0,   0], [  0, 255,   0], [  0,   0, 255]],
 [[128, 128, 128], [  0,   0,   0], [255, 255, 255]],
 [[  0,   0,   0], [255, 128,  64], [128, 192,  64]]]
In this example, the outermost array represents rows, the next array represents columns, and the innermost array represents the RGB values for each pixel.
